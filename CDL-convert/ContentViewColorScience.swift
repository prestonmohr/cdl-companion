However, these generalized descriptions have caused many interpretive issues. Each manufacturer has their own unique interpretation of these controls, leading to variations in results across different software systems. This lack of standardization prompted the American Society of Cinematographers to create a new set of mathematical transforms that would manipulate images in a predictable manner and allow for an independent, unambiguous way of describing color manipulations.\n")

The offset control, which does not have a pivot, acts like an 'exposure' control and adds or subtracts the same value to or from each original value, as opposed to a range-limited control like a lift control. This makes signal manipulation by the ASC CDL more analogous to a 'contrast and exposure' control system.\n")
